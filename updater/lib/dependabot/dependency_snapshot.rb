    # To avoid having to re-home Dependabot::Updater#handle_parser_error,
    # we perform the parsing lazily when the `dependencies` method is first
    # referenced.
    #
    # We have some unusual behaviour where we handle a parse error by
    # returning an empty dependency array in Dependabot::Updater#dependencies
    # in order to 'fall through' to an error outcome elsewhere in the class.
    #
    # Given this uncertainity, and the need to significantly refactor tests,
    # it makes sense to introduce this shim and then deal with the call
    # site once we've split out the downstream behaviour in the updater.
